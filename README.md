#Catclicker

This website is a practice page for JavaScript/jQuery.

##Folders & Files

##Using the Site
**To run the site**, place all files in the same folder, open catclicker.html in a web browser.

**To customize the files**, you can open the catclicker.html file in your favorite text editor and make changes as desired. You can make design modifications/additions in a separate css file (in this case, you can change the styles.css file). Save the files and refresh catclicker.html to see your new web page.

Mockup/basic design ideas for this application were provided by [Udacity](http://www.Udacity.com). Additional instruction on Front End Development is available by signing up for a class on their site. Bootstrap provides the framework. Additional enhancements by Marija Robinson.

I welcome any feedback on this project at marija@springmail.com.
